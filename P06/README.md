## Summary
Ranking of reasons to uninstall a mobile Application
Ling, Soo et al. conducted a study about mobile app users behaviors. They surveyed 10,208 people from more than 15 countries on their mobile app usage behavior.
Using their dataset, I have analyzed _what makes a user stop using an app?_.
Results were split between Android and iOS platforms and displayed using a bar chart.

## Design

I've decided to use a horizontal bar chart using Dimple.js. Although this is a very basic chart, that is exactly the point. Adding more features to the visualization would require extra effort from readers.

The color was used to distinguish the platform.
Length was used to code the portion of users.
The position was used for the answer selected by the user.
